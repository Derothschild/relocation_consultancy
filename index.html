    <h2>Moving to Spain: The Spanish Golden Visa Program</h2>
    <p>The Spanish Golden Visa program is a residency-by-investment program that allows non-EU citizens to obtain a Spanish residency permit by making a significant investment in the Spanish economy. The program is designed to attract foreign investment and to boost the Spanish economy.</p>
    <p>To qualify for the Spanish Golden Visa program, you must meet one of the following investment requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Invest at least €500,000 in Spanish real estate.</li>
        <li>Invest at least €1 million in Spanish government bonds or corporate bonds.</li>
        <li>Invest at least €2 million in a Spanish company.</li>
        <li>Create a new business in Spain that generates at least 10 jobs.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Once you have met one of the investment requirements, you can apply for a Spanish residency permit. The residency permit is valid for two years and can be renewed indefinitely as long as you maintain your investment.</p>
    <p>The Spanish Golden Visa program offers a number of benefits, including:</p>
      <ul>The ability to live and work in Spain.</ul>
        <li>ability to travel freely throughout the Schengen Area.</li>
        <li>The ability to apply for Spanish citizenship after five years of residency.</li>
        <li>The Spanish Golden Visa program is a great option for non-EU citizens who want to move to Spain and enjoy the benefits of living in a beautiful and prosperous country.</li>
    <p>Here are some specific benefits of moving to Spain using the Spanish Golden Visa program:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Live and work in Spain: The Spanish Golden Visa program allows you to live and work in Spain without any restrictions. This means that you can start your own business, work for a Spanish company, or retire in Spain.</li>
        <li>Travel freely throughout the Schengen Area: The Spanish Golden Visa program gives you the right to travel freely throughout the Schengen Area, which is a zone of 27 European countries that have abolished passport and other border controls. This means that you can travel to any of these countries without having to go through a border checkpoint.</li>
        <li>Apply for Spanish citizenship after five years of residency: If you live in Spain for at least five years with a Spanish Golden Visa, you can apply for Spanish citizenship. Spanish citizenship gives you the right to live and work in any EU country, as well as the right to vote and run for office.</li>
